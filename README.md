# Hotstar App Deployment Project

**Welcome to the Hotstar App Deployment project!**  
This project demonstrates how to deploy a Hotstar-like Next.js application on a Kubernetes cluster using modern DevOps practices, following a DevSecOps approach. It focuses on containerization, orchestration, monitoring, and security best practices.

## üö¶ Project Stages

### Stage 1: Docker Containerization

Containerize the Hotstar Next.js application using Docker.

Write a Dockerfile to build the application image.

Push the Docker image to a container registry (like Docker Hub or AWS ECR).

Test the container locally to ensure it runs correctly.

### Stage 2: Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

Write Terraform scripts to provision cloud resources (EC2, S3, VPC, EKS, etc.).

Organize Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, provider.tf) for modularity.

Apply Terraform scripts to create the infrastructure automatically.

### Stage 3: Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy the Dockerized application on a Kubernetes cluster (EKS).

Write Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets).

Ensure proper scaling and load balancing using Kubernetes Services.

### Stage 4: CI/CD Integration

Configure Jenkins pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment.

Integrate SonarQube for code quality checks.

Automate Docker image build and deployment to Kubernetes cluster.

### Stage 5: Monitoring & Security

Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application health and metrics.

Use Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

Implement OWASP security best practices to secure the application.
